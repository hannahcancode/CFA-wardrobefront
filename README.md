# Jules' Wardrobe

## About

Jules' wardrobe is a recreation of the infamous app from the movie Clueless - 'Cher's Closet'.

## Installation

### iPhone Simulator
- In terminal, navigate to the root folder and run:

  ```
  $ yarn install
  $ react-native run-ios
  ```

- The app will then automatically open in the Xcode simulator

### iPhone

- Sign up for an Apple Developer account
- Open the iOS Xcode file and add your developer account
- Connect your phone to your computer with USB
- Select your phone in Xcode and press play to compile the app and play on your phone.
